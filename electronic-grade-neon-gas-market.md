<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Grade Neon Gas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>5N</li><li>>5N</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electronic Grade Neon Gas is categorized into two main types based on purity levels: 5N and >5N. The 5N grade refers to gas that has a purity level of 99.999%, meaning it contains no more than 10 parts per million (ppm) of impurities. On the other hand, the >5N grade indicates an even higher purity level, typically exceeding 99.999%, with minimal impurities of less than 1 ppm. These high-purity grades are essential for electronics manufacturing processes that require precise and contaminant-free environments.</p></p>
