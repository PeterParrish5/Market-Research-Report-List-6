<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chlor-alkali Ion Exchange Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Membrane with Sacrificial Thread</li><li>Membrane without Sacrificial Thread</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Chlor-alkali Ion Exchange Membrane market can be categorized into two types based on the presence of sacrificial thread: Membrane with Sacrificial Thread and Membrane without Sacrificial Thread. Membranes with Sacrificial Thread have an additional thread embedded within the membrane that gradually dissolves over time, prolonging the membrane's lifespan. On the other hand, Membranes without Sacrificial Thread do not have this extra component, making them more cost-effective but with a potentially shorter lifespan. Both types offer unique benefits and cater to different market demands.</p></p>
