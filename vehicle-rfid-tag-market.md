<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle RFID Tag Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Vehicle RFID Tag market consists of two primary types: active and passive tags. Active tags are equipped with their own power source, enabling them to transmit signals over longer distances, making them suitable for tracking vehicles in real-time. In contrast, passive tags do not have an internal power source and rely on external readers for activation, limiting their range but offering a more cost-effective solution for applications like toll collection and vehicle identification. Each type serves distinct operational needs in vehicle management.</p></p>
