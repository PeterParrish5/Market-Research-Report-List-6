<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HVAC Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return HVAC Actuator</li><li>Non-Spring Return HVAC Actuator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The HVAC actuator market is primarily divided into two types: spring return and non-spring return actuators. Spring return HVAC actuators utilize a spring mechanism to return the valve or damper to a default position when power is lost, enhancing safety and energy efficiency. In contrast, non-spring return actuators maintain their position without a spring, relying on continuous power to operate. Both types serve critical roles in controlling airflow and temperature in HVAC systems, catering to various application requirements.</p></p>
