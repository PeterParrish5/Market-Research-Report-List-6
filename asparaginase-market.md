<p><strong>The Asparaginase Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</li><li>Acute Myeloid Leukemia</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Asparaginase is widely used in the treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) due to its ability to break down the amino acid asparagine, which is essential for the growth of cancer cells. By depriving cancer cells of asparagine, asparaginase effectively inhibits their proliferation and leads to cell death. This makes it a crucial component in the chemotherapy regimens for both ALL and AML, significantly improving patient outcomes and survival rates.</p></p>
