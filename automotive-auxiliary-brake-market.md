<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Auxiliary Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DrumBrake</li><li>DiscBrake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive auxiliary brake market can be categorized primarily into two types: drum brakes and disc brakes. Drum brakes consist of a cylindrical drum that houses brake shoes, which press against the inner surface to create friction and slow the vehicle. In contrast, disc brakes feature a flat, circular disc that is gripped by brake pads to generate stopping power. Both types serve the essential function of enhancing vehicle braking performance, particularly in heavy-duty applications, improving safety and control during operation.</p></p>
