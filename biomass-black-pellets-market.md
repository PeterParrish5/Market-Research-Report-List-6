<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biomass Black Pellets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biomass black pellets market is primarily categorized into two types: torrefaction and steam explosion (SE). Torrefaction involves heating biomass in an oxygen-deprived environment, enhancing energy density and making pellets more hydrophobic, which improves transportation and storage. In contrast, steam explosion (SE) utilizes high-pressure steam followed by rapid decompression to disrupt biomass structure, increasing surface area for improved processing and combustion efficiency. Both methods aim to produce high-quality black pellets for renewable energy applications, enhancing sustainability.</p></p>
