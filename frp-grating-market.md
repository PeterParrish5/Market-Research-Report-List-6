<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FRP Grating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Molded FRP Grating</li><li>Pultruded FRP Grating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>FRP grating market comprises two primary types: molded and pultruded grating. Molded FRP grating is produced by combining resin and glass fibers in a mold, resulting in a lightweight, corrosion-resistant product ideal for applications like walkways and platforms. Pultruded FRP grating, on the other hand, is manufactured by pulling resin-impregnated fibers through a heated die, offering superior strength and durability, making it suitable for heavy-load applications and industrial environments. Both types provide excellent chemical resistance and low maintenance.</p></p>
