<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Super Generic Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Traditional Generic Drugs</li><li>Biosimilars</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The super generic drugs market encompasses two main types: traditional generic drugs and biosimilars. Traditional generic drugs are copies of brand-name medications that contain the same active ingredients, dosage forms, and administration routes, but are marketed under their chemical names once the original patent expires. Biosimilars, on the other hand, are biologic products highly similar to an already approved reference biologic drug, differing in minor aspects. Both types offer cost-effective alternatives, improving patient access to essential therapies.</p></p>
