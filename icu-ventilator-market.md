<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ICU Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ICU ventilator market is segmented into two main types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators are connected to the patient's airway through an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy, delivering air directly into the lungs. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, provide air through a mask placed over the patient's nose and mouth, avoiding the need for invasive intubation. Both types of ventilators play a crucial role in delivering oxygen to patients in critical care settings, helping to support their respiratory function.</p></p>
