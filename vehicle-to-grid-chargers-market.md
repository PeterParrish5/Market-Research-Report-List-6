<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle to Grid Chargers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC Vehicle to Grid Chargers</li><li>DC Vehicle to Grid Chargers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vehicle to Grid (V2G) chargers allow electric vehicles to not only charge from the grid, but also discharge energy back into the grid when needed. There are two main types of V2G chargers: AC and DC. AC V2G chargers use alternating current to provide bi-directional energy flow between the vehicle and the grid. DC V2G chargers, on the other hand, use direct current for energy transfer. Both types play a crucial role in supporting grid stability and balancing energy demand.</p></p>
