<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Robotic Sprayed Concrete System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Mix</li><li>Wet Mix</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Robotic Sprayed Concrete System market consists of two types: Dry Mix and Wet Mix. In Dry Mix, the concrete mixture is prepared before being fed into the robotic spraying equipment. This method is often used for smaller projects that require precise control over the mixture. In Wet Mix, the concrete mixture is combined with water before being sprayed, allowing for a faster application process and more flexibility in terms of adjusting the consistency of the mixture. Wet Mix is commonly used for larger projects that require higher volumes of concrete to be applied quickly.</p></p>
